                <h1>About Us</h1>


                <p>A Guide For Your Luxury Stay None of us wants to make a bad hotel choice and suffer through an unpleasant stay. Yet, thoroughly researching each hotel prospect can be a time-consuming process. So, most of us skim the guest reviews, check
                    the prices and roll the dice on a hotel. Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. Well, we want it to work out for you every time and so that’s why we’ve introduced our Editor’s Picks. Our Editor's Picks are all hand-picked
                    by us personally (not some computer algorithm). We take great care to research each hotel carefully, scouring the web for guest feedback from numerous sources and confirming important information directly with the hotel. We then choose
                    the best of these to become our Editor's Picks -- hotels that deliver well on their intended promise and purpose, whether they are 5-star luxury properties or cheap and cheerful budget accommodations. Not all Editor’s Picks are equal,
                    but we aim to give you solid choices with a variety of price ranges, locations and amenities that you can book with confidence.
